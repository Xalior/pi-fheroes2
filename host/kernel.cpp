//
// kernel.cpp — brings the board up, then hands control to fheroes2.
//
// fheroes2 is an ordinary command-line program: it expects a working
// standard library, a filesystem holding the Heroes II data files, and an
// SDL2 implementation. This file supplies the first two and starts the
// third, then calls the game's entry point with a fixed argument list.
//
// EVERYTHING THIS GAME TOUCHES LIVES IN ONE DIRECTORY ON THE CARD,
// RAPI_GAME_DIR, which the host Makefile sets. One card carries several
// games, and two of them writing an `fheroes2.cfg` into the card's root
// would each silently overwrite the other's.
//
// Four things point at it, and between them they cover every path the game
// can reach:
//
//   FHEROES2_DATA   upstream's own build knob for the data directory. The
//                   host Makefile defines it as RAPI_GAME_DIR, and the game
//                   puts it first in its root-directory search list. No
//                   patch: the knob already exists and is simply pointed.
//   argv[0]         an absolute path inside the directory. The game adds
//                   the parent directory of argv[0] to the same search list.
//   SDL_GetPrefPath answers with it (see circle_stubs.cpp), which is where
//                   the configuration, the save games and the high scores
//                   go.
//   chdir()         this kernel makes it the working directory before the
//                   game starts, so anything opened by a relative name
//                   lands there too rather than in the card's root.
//
// This kernel also decides the core layout (see kernel.h for the roles) and
// hands one core to the shim's presentation worker. The library never starts
// a core; electing one is the host's job, and this is where it happens. The
// game itself knows none of it: it calls plain SDL, and its file access
// reaches the marshalled I/O service through the syscall layer in
// circle_syscalls.cpp.
